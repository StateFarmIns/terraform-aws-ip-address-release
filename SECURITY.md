## Reporting Security Issues

Thank you for your concern in identifying and disclosing to us security issues and vulnerabilities. We take every effort to make security a top priority.

To report a security vulnerability, please email <OS-Program-Office@statefarm.com>. Include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line. We will be in contact with you and will work through GitHub's Security Advisories, within our GitHub repository, to discuss, fix, and publish information about security vulnerabilities within our repository's code. We will keep you informed throughout the progress and may ask you for additional information to help resolve the security issue..

We appreciate your help as a contributor and will always do our best to acknowledge your contributions to '<our project>'.


Notes below this line ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Very rarely does a program accept reports through GitHub. Contact the security team, the org open source team, or if possible use a 
bug bounty platform such as HackerOne or Bugcrowd. 

Another option is the one above which uses a specific email address to send to.

A final decision needs to be made on how the community can safely and 
privately report vulnerabilities.
